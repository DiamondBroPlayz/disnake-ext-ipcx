discord-ext-ipcx is a maintained, tested version of the now old discord-ext-ipc library for discord.py v2. 
It strives to maintain the compatibly of ``discord-ext-ipc`` but with some modern upgrades and touch-ups. 

Getting Started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Although ``discord-ext-ipcx`` is mostly compatible with the old way of doing things, 
it is recommended to see the examples in order to know how to use it.

:doc:`examples` can be found here.

In short, the examples use the new ``setup_hook`` to load the server within the examples instead.
